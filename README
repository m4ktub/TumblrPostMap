Tumblr Post Map
===============

This fragments of Javascript and HTML are meant to allow the easy creation of
travel blogs in Tumblr. The idea is that you can write you posts normally
and by adding an extra piece of information (the latitude and longitude) you 
can have a custom page, automatically updated, with Google Map and all your 
posts marked there. A specific micro format is used to insert the coordinates
in each post. The posts must also be tagged "geo" to be included in the map.
